# showcase

## This repo copies the  with json files with the proper contribution format to facilitate transfering Coding Train contributions from old website.

## The video folder should be renamed with the number of the challenge followed by the name, for example: 160-spring-forces

## My strategy for moving to the new website has been to copy the md file on the old website use the side by side view to quickly copy and paste the information.  The formating is different enough that I have not used find and replace.  [Maybe someone could come up with a program (maybe python?) that could use regular expressions to reformat, if a lot of people are going to be moving 1 or 2 challenges from the old website I am not sure it is worth the effort to figure that out.]

## I have called the  "Group of links title" "References"
      
## There is a description field for the code examples and reference videos that you will need to fill out which could involve visiting the sites to get a good description.

## Once I had everything copied over and added the corresponding png files, I uploaded the whole folder to new branch on my fork of the website and created a pull request. 

## Here are links to the templates on the website:
